    <h1 id="headingone">Necessary Elements of Any Location I Go To:</h1>
    <p id="travelyet">
      I have yet to travel to every city I plan to travel to, so I don’t want to
      declare a favorite place (Except for New York City; nothing could ever
      make me hate NYC). However, I have favorite characteristics of different
      locations I've seen online or once in real life.

    <p class="mountainscape">
      Mountains are a necessity in the landscape of a location because they are
      so gorgeous and breath-taking. This year I went to Europe and saw the
      swiss alps and they were <em>stunning</em>. It was a bit cold but it was
      worth it for the mountains.

    <h3 class="cats">A Plethora of Cats</h3>

      id="carcluster"
    />
    <p class="cats">
      There should be cats wherever I go. (There's an exception if its a museum
      or something). Cats are my favorite animal. It doesn't matter how many
      cats are at that location, but <em>I</em> prefer <em>many</em> cats. Some
      cities have stray cats that are considered a part of their community, and
      the cats are fed and pet by random people who pass by. <br />
      I <em>will</em> be one of those random people that pass by to feed and pet
      the cats...

      id="yummay"
    />
    <p class="food">
      There has to be good food at the location I travel to. I am very eager and
      willing to try new foods, but the foods I try <em>must</em> be awesome.
      (This is not really a big issue whenever I travel because food is
      <em>delicious</em> everywhere, but just in case.)

    <p class="cityscape">
      If there are no mountains at a location or if the mountains are too far
      away to see, I would want to visit a city instead. Yes, I already live in
      a city, and I travel to Manhattan every day, but I <em>still</em> have yet
      to see every single acre of the city. I live in Queens and still haven’t
      seen every part of it. So, certain places in NYC count as places I would
      like to "visit.” If a city is not huge like NYC it can be cute and quaint
      like the picture below.
